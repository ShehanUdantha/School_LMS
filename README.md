Nowadays, learning management system applications play a significant role in increasing engagement between students and staff. Here, we decided to develop a mobile application for our university I.T. faculty. It connects staff, lecturers, and students. Moreover, this application uses to  coordinate all the functionalities of the I.T. faculty. Furthermore, both students and the staff can be able to interact effectively through this application and it is an excellent opportunity for the  students to improve their performance and discuss any issues directly. However, this application has many more benefits for the people engaged in the teaching-learning process.
